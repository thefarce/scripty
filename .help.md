Available Scripts

  build
      Build the code found in ./src and output the compiled contents to ./dist

  clean
      Removes the ./reports directory.

  docs:build
      Run docs:build:jsdoc.  If it succeeds, run docs:build:site.

  docs:build:jsdoc
      Build the jsdocs.  By default, this builds with the following
      parameters:
  
      - package file  ./package.json
      - config file   ./config/jsdoc.config.json
      - readme file   ./README.md
      - template      @thefarce/jsdoc-to-json
      - output path   ./pub/src
  
      The output path drops the jsdoc json file into the ./src dir of the
      react app that serves as the repository's homepage.

  docs:build:site
      Builds the react app that serves as the repository's home page.  This
      should be done after building the jsdocs json file (docs:build:jsdoc).

  docs:deploy
      Builds the docs (docs:build:jsdoc), then builds the react app
      (docs:build:site), then deploys the built react app to github pages.

  help
      Displays this help content.

  style
      Runs eslint and reports any style problems found according to the
      configuration provided in ./config/eslint.config.cjs.
      By default uses the reporter eslint-html-reporter.
      Outputs a report to ./reports/style/index.html.

  style:fix
      Runs the same as the style command (style) but repairs any issues
      addressable by eslint.  This cannot automatically fix all style issues,
      but it can fix many such as spacing flaws.

  test
      Runs the test suite.  Loads the Jest configuration found in
      ./config/jest.test.config.json

  test:coverage
      Runs the tests as with the test command (test) but also creates a report
      of test coverage.  After the coverage report is generated, the report is
      copeied to ./reports/test-coverage.

  test:spec
      Runs the specification test suite.  Loads the configuration found in
      ./config/jest.spec.config.json.

  validate
      Runs the style command (style) and then the test coverage command
      (test:coverage).  The resultant output shows all problems with the code.
